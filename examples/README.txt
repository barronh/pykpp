pykpp Example Gallery
=====================

This gallery houses examples on how to use pykpp to do various
analyses. This includes downloading and visualizing the data.

Some examples require some features of pykpp that are not required
for minimal functionality. To install all the necessary libaries
for any example, run the command below (use --user if not an admin):

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install --user https://github.com/barronh/pykpp/archive/main.zip

In notebooks (e.g., on Google Colab), this can be done live with
the command below (may require kernel restart):

.. code-block:: python

   %pip install --user https://github.com/barronh/pykpp/archive/main.zip

To run an example in a notebook:

1. Copy the command above into a new cell and run it.
2. Click on example below to see code.
3. Copy the code from the example into a new cell and run it.
